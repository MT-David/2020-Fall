# Quick class orientation

# Course mantras

Here are some philosophies that will get you far in data analytic work. We will be revisiting these over and over again.

**1) Embrace plain text**

You will write code to produce rich outputs that include text and graphics. While your output may have lots of different formatting, your code will be written in [**plain text**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text).

**2) Embrace reproducibility**

Everything you produce in this course will be a [reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) output. That is, you should be able to reproduce your output from the raw data and code.

For example, This webpage was generated from [this markdown source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emse-p4a-gwu/2020-Fall/master/L1.1-course-introduction.Rmd) on GitHub. If you want to generate this very HTML page, download the `.Rmd` file and run the following code in R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render('L1.1-course-introduction.Rmd')
```

# The syllabus

Take a look at the [syllabus](syllabus.html). This is your contract for the course - review it to learn what will be expected of you throughout the semester and how you will be assessed.

# The schedule

The course [schedule](schedule.html) is your roadmap for the semester. Visit it often to make sure you are well-prepared for class and aware of upcoming assignment / quiz dates.

# Communication & Help

This can be a challenging class - don't suffer in silence! Look at the ["Getting Help"](ref-getting-help.html) page, come to office hours, send me a message on Slack.
