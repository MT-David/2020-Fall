General:
- Add early discussion of Polya problem solving: Solve problem before coding - come up with a plan, then execute the code
- Add strings to final review slides
- Add R Tips to start of each lecture

1-Basics:
- Horst camel case image
- Add 'productivity.png' image
- Add package_lightbulb.jpg image

3-Functions:
- Include the `almostEqual()` and `is.integer.val()` functions
- Code style lecture?

4-Testing & debugging:
- Include Jenny's meme about ignoring the error messages, from this video: https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/object-of-type-closure-is-not-subsettable-jenny-bryan

5-Loops:
- Greater discussion of iteration in each loop type, esp. with while loops
- Use the walkThroughDigits(n) function first before going on to isPrime

6-Vectors:
- Add %in%

12-data-visualization:
- Add small mulitples in with faceting


Potential New Topics:
- Lecture on building a program. Abstracting away functions that can be repeatedly used, and otherwise good programming practices: https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-habits-data-scientists
- Lecture on building a package (potentially instead of monte carlo lecture).
- If time, add lecture on tidy data and joins
