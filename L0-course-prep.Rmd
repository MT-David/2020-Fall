This page has everything you need to do to prepare for class. 

**You should do all these things _before_ the first day of class.**

First, register for the following tools:

- **Slack**: the link to sign up for the course slack page is on the announcement on Blackboard.
- Install the Slack app on your phone and **turn notifications on!**
- [RStudio Cloud](https://login.rstudio.cloud/register): use whatever email you wish to register for this - we'll use it for some in-class activities and quizzes.

Next, install the latest version of R and RStudio:

- [Download and install R](https://cloud.r-project.org)
- [Download and install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (Desktop version)

**We will always work in RStudio**, so be careful to open RStudio and not the default R application that comes with R:

<div style="width:200px">
Open this   | Not this!
:----------:|:----------:

</div>

That's it - you're all set for class!
