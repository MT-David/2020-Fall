This page has everything you need to do to prepare for class. 

You should do all these things _before_ the first day of class.

First, register for the following:

- [Slack](https://emse-p4a-f20.slack.com): the link to sign up for the course slack page is on the announcement on Blackboard.
- Install the Slack app on your phone and **Turn notifications on!**
- [RStudio Cloud](https://login.rstudio.cloud/register): we'll use this for some in-class activities and quizzes.

Next, install R and RStudio:

- [Download and install R](https://cloud.r-project.org).
- [Download and install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (Desktop version).

**We will always work in RStudio**, so be careful to open RStudio and not the default R application that comes with R:

Open this   | Not this
