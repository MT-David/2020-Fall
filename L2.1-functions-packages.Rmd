# Functions

You can do a lot with the basic operators like `+`, `-`, and `*`, but to do more advanced calculations you're going to need to start using functions.^[Technically speaking, operators are functions in R: the addition operator `+` is a convenient way of calling the addition function `'+'()`. Thus `10+20` is equivalent to the function call `'+'(20, 30)`. Not surprisingly, no-one ever uses this version.]

R has a lot of very useful built-in functions. Suppose I wanted to take the square root of 225. The usual notation for this is $\sqrt{25}=5$, though sometimes you'll also see it written like this $25^{0.5} = 5$. This second way of writing it is kind of useful to "remind" you of the mathematical fact that "square root of $x$" is actually the same as "raising $x$ to the power of 0.5". And since we already know how to raise things to powers in R, we could do this:

```{r}
225 ^ 0.5
```

However, we could also compute this using R's built-in square root function `sqrt()`:

```{r}
sqrt(225)
```

Not sure what a particular function does? You can ask R for help by typing `?` and then the function name, and R will return documentation on the function. For example, `?sqrt()` will return information about the `sqrt()` function.

## Some common functions

Function   | Description       | Example
---------- | ------------------|------------------------------
`exp()`    | Exponential  | `exp(0)` returns ``r exp(0)``
`sqrt()`   | Square root  | `sqrt(64)` returns ``r sqrt(64)``
`log(x)`   | Natural log of `x` | `log(1)` returns ``r log(1)``
`factorial()` | Factorial | `factorial(5)` returns ``r factorial(5)``
`round(x, digits=0)` | Round `x` to the `digits` decimal place | `round(3.1415, digits=2)` returns ``r round(3.1415, digits=2)``
`abs(x)`  | Absolute value of `x` | `abs(-42)` returns ``r abs(-42)``

## Combining functions

In the same way that R allows us to put multiple operations together into a longer command (like `1 + 2 * 4` for instance), it also lets us put functions together and even combine functions with operators if we so desire. For example, the following is a perfectly legitimate command:

```{r}
sqrt(1 + abs(-8))
```

When R executes this command, starts out by calculating the value of `abs(-8)`, which produces an intermediate value of `8`. The command then simplifies to `sqrt(1 + 8)`. To solve the square root^[R does support complex numbers, but unless you explicitly specify that you want them it assumes all calculations must be real valued. By default, the square root of a negative number is treated as undefined: `sqrt(-9)` will produce `NaN` (not a number) as its output. To get complex numbers, you would type `sqrt(-9+0i)` and R would now return `0+3i`.] it first needs to add `1 + 8` to get `9`, at which point it evaluates `sqrt(9)`, and so it finally outputs a value of `3`.

## Arguments

When we use a function to do something, we generally refer to this as **calling** the function. The values that we type into the function are referred to as the **arguments** of that function. Some functions can have more than one argument.

> [Watch this 1-minute video for a quick summary of **arguments**](https://vimeo.com/220490157)


## Multiple arguments

Some functions have more than one argument. For example, the `round()` function can be used to round some value to the nearest whole number. For example, I could type this:

```{r}
round(3.1415)
```

Pretty straightforward. However, suppose I only wanted to round it to two decimal places: that is, I want to get `3.14` as the output. To do this, you can input a second argument that specifies the number of decimal places that you want to round the number to. To get `3.14`, I would type this:

```{r}
round(3.14165, 2)
```

## Argument names

In this simple example, it's not too hard to remember which argument comes first and which one comes second, but it starts to get very difficult once you start using complicated functions that have lots of arguments. Fortunately, most R functions use **argument names** to make your life a little easier. For the `round()` function, for example, the number that needs to be rounded is specified using the `x` argument, and the number of decimal points that you want it rounded to is specified using the `digits` argument:

```{r}
round(x = 3.1415, digits = 2)
```

## Default values

Notice that the first time I called the `round()` function I didn't actually specify the `digits` argument at all, and yet R somehow knew that this meant it should round to the nearest whole number. How did that happen? The answer is that the `digits` argument has a **default value** of `0`, meaning that if you decide not to specify a value for `digits` then R will act as if you had typed `digits = 0`. This is quite handy: most of the time when you want to round a number you want to round it to the nearest *whole* number, and it would be pretty annoying to have to specify the `digits` argument every single time. On the other hand, sometimes you actually do want to round to something other than the nearest whole number, and it would be even more annoying if R didn't allow this! Thus, by having `digits = 0` as the default value, we get the best of both worlds.

Finally, not all functions have (or require) arguments:

```{r}
date() # Returns the current date and time
```

# Packages

When you start R, it only loads the "Base R" functions (e.g. `sqrt()`, `round()`, etc.), but there are thousands and thousands of additional functions stored in external **packages**.

## Installing and loading packages 

To install a package, use the `install.packages()` command. Make sure you put the package name in quotes:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("packagename") # This works
install.packages(packagename)   # This doesn't work
```

Once you have a package _installed_, you still have to _load_ it every time you open an R session. You don't have to use quotes to load it (but you can if you want):

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("packagename") # This works
library(packagename)   # This also works
```

**Important**: You only need to _install_ a package to your computer _once_, but you will need to _load_ it whenever you want to use it in an R session. Think of it this way:

## Example

As an example, try installing the [Wikifacts](https://github.com/keithmcnulty/wikifacts) package, by Keith McNulty:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("wikifacts") # Remember - you only have to do this once!
```

Now that you have the package installed on your computer, try loading it using `library(wikifacts)`, then trying using some of it's functions:

```{r}
library(wikifacts) # Load the library
```
```{r}
wiki_randomfact()
wiki_didyouknow()
```

In case you're wondering, the only thing this package does is generate messages containing random facts from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).
